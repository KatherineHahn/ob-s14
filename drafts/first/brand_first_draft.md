##A Decomposition of the Main Ingredients in Red Bull

Red Bull. It’s a name synonymous with energy and energy drinks, which over the years have increased in popularity. While many people drink them, they don’t always know how its ingredients affect their body. The main ingredients in Red Bull are caffeine, taurine, glucose, glucruonolactone, B3, B5, B6, B12 and sucrose, all of which are naturally occurring. 

“That’s probably one of the dilemmas you face with energy drinks such as this. Because they’re all natural I believe they’re sometimes kind of hard to regulate, you know as a supplemental drink or an energy drink,” UF professor Maurice Marshall said in a phone interview. 

Here is the list of main ingredients in a red bull and how they work. 

Caffeine

Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system. According to Marshall that means it speeds up different sections of the brain, which in turn speeds up metabolism. 

“You know it kind of makes you hyper in a sense,” Marshall said. 

Caffeine is often used in diet pills because in addition to it speeding up metabolism it also speeds up cellular energy in a way that helps burn calories.
Taurine

Glucose

According to Marshall, glucose is a metabolizer and helps to produce cellular energy. However when it breaks down it also forms calories.

Glucruonolactone

When glucose is broken down it forms into glucrunolactone. According to Marshall from there it forms into a glucaric acid as metabolites excrete from the body. In food science its used as an ingredient or an additive. When asked if ingesting both glucose and glucrunolactone is harmful to the body, Marshall said he didn’t think so. 

B3

Vitamin B3, or niacin, is a major pro factor, meaning it is needed for when fats, proteins or carbohydrates enter the body. Niacin works to break those down to form cellular energy. 

B5

B5 is helpful in producing energy, especially from glucose and fats. It is another source of cellular energy.

B6

B6 is pyrodoxin and is primarily important in protein metabolism. But according to Marshall B6 itself doesn’t belong in an energy drink because it typically doesn’t relate to energy. 

“Because of the fact that it doesn’t seem to afford itself to energy unless it helps to metabolize protein for energy from a protein source, but something we don’t like to make energy from is protein,” Marshall said.

B12

This is involved in nerve protection, red blood cell protection and the development associated with that. I offers up some help in brain stimulation, which helps carry over the speeding up of metabolism. 

Sucrose
