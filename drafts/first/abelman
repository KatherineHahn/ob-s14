# Mr. Positive Push

* Hospital 

"I never, ever, ever thought I would end up in a hospital, never. 
I didn’t even know that kind of stuff happened. I go to the hospital. 
I’m in there. It’s weird. I kind of can’t believe it." 


“I was on a streak. I was on a hot streak, and I was feeling good. 
At that point, that’s when I kind of messed up with my medication. 
I was feeling so good, I said maybe I don’t need these meds. 
I got sick and went on antibiotic and then I kind of spiraled out of control. 
I was going nuts on Twitter. I was yelling at people and I was off my meds. 
Zac and everybody intervened and I went to the hospital.
